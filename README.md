# Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model and a supporting dashboard to differentiate between healthy cherry leaves and those infected with powdery mildew. The project fulfills two main business requirements:
1. Conduct a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one infected with powdery mildew.
2. Predict if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains images of cherry leaves, categorized into healthy and powdery mildew-infected classes. [Dataset source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves).

## Business Requirements
### BR1: Visual Differentiation Study
- Average and variability images analysis for each class.
- Differences between average healthy and powdery mildew-infected leaves.
- Image montage for each class.

### BR2: Mildew Detection
- Develop a binary classification model using Neural Networks.
- The model inputs cherry leaf images, predicting their health status.

## Dashboard
The project dashboard provides:
- A project summary including dataset information and client requirements.
- Visual differentiation study findings.
- Mildew detection functionality with image upload and prediction results.
- Hypothesis validation and model performance metrics.

## Model
The binary classification model aims for a performance goal of 97% accuracy, ensuring high-quality predictions that benefit the client by preventing the distribution of compromised products.

## Ethical Considerations
Data is provided under an NDA, restricting its sharing to officially involved professionals.
